# Project Description
 
Chess is widely renowned as one of the most skill intensive games ever invented. Both sides begin the game with identical pieces in an identical position, there are no random elements (aside from assigning the first move), and the movement of those pieces during a game can result in over 121 million possible combinations in just the fist three moves. Because of this, the player with the most skill is likely to win the grand majority of chess games. I have decided to look into the different elements of a chess game to determine if any of them increase or decrease the chance of a player with lower skill defeating a player with greater skill.
 
# Project Goal
 
* Discover drivers of upsets in chess games played on Lichess.org
* Use drivers to develop a machine learning model to classify games as ending in upset or not ending in upset
* An upset is defined as a lower rated player defeating a higher rated player. 
* This information could be used to further our understanding of which game elements contribute to or detract from a gameâ€™s skill intensity.
 
# Initial Thoughts
 
My initial hypothesis is that drivers of upsets will be elements that either grant an outright advantage to one player or increase the likelihood of players making mistakes.
 
# The Plan
 
* Aquire data from Code Up Database
 
* Prepare data
   * Create Engineered columns from existing data
       * upset
       * rating_difference
       * game_rating
       * lower_rated_white
       * time_control_group
 
* Explore data in search of drivers of upsets
   * Answer the following initial questions
       * How often do upsets occur?
       * Does first move advantage affect upsets?
       * Does a game being rated affect upsets?
       * Does the average rating of both players have an effect on upsets?
       * Does time block affect upsets?
       * Does a player's choice of opening affect upsets?
      
* Develop a Model to predict if a chess game will end in an upset
   * Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types
   * Evaluate models on train and validate data
   * Select the best model based on highest accuracy
   * Evaluate the best model on test data
 
* Draw conclusions
 
# Data Dictionary

| Feature | Definition |
|:--------|:-----------|
|Rated| True or False, The game's result is reflected in each player's rating|
|Winning Pieces| The color of pieces the winning player was moving|
|White Rating| Rating of the player moving the white pieces using the Glicko-2 rating method for games played on Lichess|
|Black Rating| Rating of the player moving the white pieces using the Glicko-2 rating method for games played on Lichess|
|Rating Difference| The difference in rating between the players in the game|
|Game Rating| The average rating of the two players in the game|
|Lower Rated White| True or False, The lower rated player is moving the white pieces|
|Opening Name| The name of the opening played in the game|
|Time Control Group| The amount of time allotted to each player to make their moves, **Standard** (60 min or more), **Rapid** (30 - 15 min), **Blitz** (5 - 3 min), or **Bullet** (2 or less), **Other** (any other time limit)|
|Upset (Target)| True or False, The lower rated player won the game|
|Additional Features|Encoded and values for categorical data and scaled versions continuous data|
 
# Steps to Reproduce
1) Clone this repo.
2) Acquire the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess)
3) Put the data in the file containing the cloned repo.
4) Run notebook.
 
# Takeaways and Conclusions
* Upsets occur in 1/3 of games
* In games where the lower rated player moves first there is a 4% greater chance of an upset
* Games that are rated have a 3% higher chance of an upset
* Games with a "quick" time control (30 min or less) have about a 1 in 3 chance of upset
* Games with a "slow" time control (60 min or more) have about a 1 in 5 chance of upset
* The mean rating of players in a game is not a driver of upsets
* The difference in player rating is a driver of upsets
* A player's choice of opening is a driver of upsets, however its influence is complicated and I would need more time to discover what role it plays
 
# Recommendations
* To increase the skill intensity of a game add to the length of time players are able to consider their moves
* Based on the data longer time controls make it less likely for a less skilled player to beat a more skilled player
