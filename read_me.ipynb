    "Customer retention is arguably the most important aspect of a long lasting, profitable business. Considering the massive proportion of gross profit business' spend on new customer aquisition, we can easily understand the value of retaining these customers. This begs the literal million dollar question- why have our customers left? And what actionable information can we draw from a scientific approach to analyzing our customer data? We will be exploring that in this project."
